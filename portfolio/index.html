            <p>Hey Guys! I'm Dhruv. Welcome to my first portfolio website!</p>
            <p>So, a little bit about me. I grew up in the suburban city of Thane(near Mumbai). I attended Hiranandani Foundation School, Thane.
                Currently I'm studying <strong>Computer and Communications Engineering</strong> at the <strong>Manipal Institute of Technology</strong>.
                Since I was a kid, I've had an interest in computers and technology in general. My father has worked in the gaming industry since I was a kid, 
                so I was always surrounded by more devices than I could handle! I have experience of coding in <strong><em>Java</em></strong>, with some experience in <strong><em>C and Python</em></strong> as well.
                I'm excited about coding, and firmly believe it's something everybody must learn(At least the basics).
                Apart from this, growing up, I dabbled in a lot of things, such as drawing, skating, squash, cricket, taekwondo, etc.
                My greatest hobby(dare I say love) is singing, having trained for 4 years in Indian Classical music.
            </p>
            <p>Through this webpage, I begin my journey into the fascinating world of web development. I have a long way to go, but I'm eager to learn!</p>
